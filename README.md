# www.steadyarc.net Website Project

This was my second website development project for a client. Steady Arc is a Chicago based property management company.

I was provided with the text and images for the investors page and was given a variety of logos to select from which also gave me a two color palette to work with. I was responsible for all remaining design work, including the selection of any images.

Based on what I learned on my first project and on the Steady Arc content provided to me, I started from a responsive design position and separated my code into four distinct media queries each in their own CSS file. While working on the site I learned about CSS background-image and took a short course on CSS grid. I ended up incorporating both of these into my site design which made it a lot more flexible.

I tested and debugged using the Chrome and Firefox development tools as well as BrowserStack.
