# www.steadyarc.net Website Project

This was my second website development project for a client. Steady Arc is a Chicago based property management company.

I was given responsibity for all design work including the selection of any images.

Based on what I learned on my first project I started from a responsive design position and separated my code into three distinct media queries and CSS files. I was able to get a range of versions of the Steady Arc logo which helped inform my color selections. While working on the site I learned about CSS background-image and took a short course on CSS grid. I ended up incorporating both of these into my site design which made it a lot more flexible.

The site is live for testing (okayed with the client) but unfinished because I'm still waiting for some verbiage from the client for the linked pages.

I test and debug using the Chrome and Firefox development tools as well as BrowserStack.
