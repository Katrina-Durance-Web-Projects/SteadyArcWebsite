        <header class="bold">Why Invest in Real Estate?</header>
        <p>
            One of the major questions for people interested in investing in real estate is WHY?  
            What makes real estate a better investment than the stock market or other investments?  
            Below, we’ll review a few good reasons real estate is one of the best long term investments 
            to really build wealth.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            1 - Your income from real estate tracks inflation
        </p>
        <p>
            While the Federal Reserve is focused on keeping inflation low, it does still exist and chips away 
            at your investments.  But the cash flow from real estate automatically adjusts to market conditions.  
            The graph below shows that since 1999 the price of housing (i.e. the rent you receive and the 
            ultimate sale price of the property) tracks with the CPI for all items.

        <p class="bold">
            2 - Low correlation with stock market
        </p>
        <p>
            A good investment profile includes both stocks and other investments.  
            Stocks have some advantages, but also have limitations.  
            Stocks are an intangible asset that has no intrinsic value until it is sold.  
            The returns on individual stocks are extremely volatile and can and are subject 
            to quick market shifts.  Even Index Funds are subject to market shifts.  
            Stock Market crashes occur over the course of days or weeks.  
            So you have to pay attention to your portfolio if you’re going to actively invest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Real estate is a counterpoint to the volatility and risk involved in the stock market.  
            You own a tangible asset that can be insured against physical loss.  Returns are 
            more predictable and any market cycles play out over the course of months and 
            years, not days.  There are also substantial tax benefits that are associated with 
            real estate investments like depreciation and deduction of expenses.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            3 - Real Estate is a great store of long term value
        </p>
        <p>
            Real estate, since it’s a tangible asset, is a good store of long term value.  
            Macro-economic trends point to real estate values increasing over the long term.  
            There are a few factors influencing this.
        </p>
        <p>
            a)  The number of renters is increasing
        </p>
        <p>
            More and more households are renting.  The Pew Research study of Census data below 
            shows that there are a higher percentage of renters now than since 1965.  The trend 
            for the last 15 years shows a steady and significant increase in the number of renting households.
        </p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="images/rentals.png" alt="graph - household heads who rent their home" class="enlarge">
        </div>
        <p>
            b) Housing inventory is down            
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the reasons the number of renting households is increasing is that the inventory of 
            available homes is decreasing.  Units available for rent have been decreasing since a peak 
            at the end of the Great Recession and are currently at their lowest levels since 2003.
        </p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="images/vacant-housing.png" alt="graph - US vacant housing units for rent" class="enlarge">
        </div>
        <p>
            c) Housing inventory is likely to stay down.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the main drivers of housing inventory is the supply of new housing.  
            Despite the increasing numbers of renters, the number of housing starts is low.
        </p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="images/housing-inventory.png" alt="graph - new housing inventory" class="enlarge">
        </div>
        <p>
            The majority of the cost of new housing is labor, which will be in short supply for the 
            foreseeable future.  Young workers have not been entering the trades, which has been 
            driving up the cost of construction.  In 2012, the average age of a skilled tradesperson was 45.  
            These workers will soon be retiring and few younger workers are set to take up the jobs. 
        </p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="images/skilled-trades-vs-all-jobs.png" alt="graph - skilled trades vs all jobs by age" class="enlarge">
        </div>
        <p>
            In addition to a shortage of workers, the COVID pandemic has also spiked the price of materials.  
            Prices for construction lumber have spiked 75% from January 2020 to January 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            Steel and lumber prices have risen over the past year.
        </p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="images/building-material-costs.png" alt="table - building materials costs" class="enlarge">
        </div>
        <p>
            These increased costs will keep the supply of housing constrained and drive up the costs of 
            both new and existing housing.  This will keep renters renting and consequently keep rents 
            high as well.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            4 - Tax benefits
        </p>
        <p>
            Real estate uniquely provides access to tax deductions and benefits that stocks do not. 
            These benefits include:
            <ul>
                <li>Depreciation (non-cash expense) deduction from income</li>
                <li>Mortgage interest tax deductions from income (now capped)</li>
                <li>Deduction of operating expenses:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="sublist-items">Utilities</li>
                    <li class="sublist-items">Cost of Repairs, Maintenance and upkeep</li>
                    <li class="sublist-items">Cost of Services (property management fees, legal fees or other services)</li>
                    <li class="sublist-items">Travel costs associated with the property</li>
                    <li class="sublist-items">Property Taxes</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Capital Gains from the sale of real estate can be deferred via Section 1031 exchange</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            5 - Cash flow
        </p>
        <p>
            While some stocks will pay dividends, the majority of the income from stock market assets 
            comes from their sale, at which point you no longer own the asset.  Real estate generates 
            reliable and consistent cash flow.  A good real estate investment puts cash in your accounts 
            every month.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            6 - Interest rates are at historic lows
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the largest advantages of real estate is the access to leverage.  You would be hard 
            pressed to find an advisor who would advise borrowing money to invest in the stock market.  
            But it would be difficult to find anyone advising you don’t use leverage with real estate.  This 
            means your $100,000 investment can easily purchase an asset worth $500,000. Interest rates 
            are currently at all time lows.  This drives returns up and maximizes cash flow as well.
